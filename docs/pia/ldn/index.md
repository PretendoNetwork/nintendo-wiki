title: LDN
---

This page describes the wireless protocol that is used to communicate with nearby consoles in LDN mode, which is the default mode for local multiplayer on Nintendo Switch.

Unless specified otherwise, everything is encoded in big-endian byte order.

## Overview
LDN enables communication between nearby consoles. LDN operates at the data link layer, so it requires a good understanding of the [IEEE 802.11 specification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9363693).

The host of the session acts as an access point and broadcasts a vendor-specific [action frame](#advertisement-frame) every 100 milliseconds. To find nearby consoles, the console scans for these action frames. During host migration the network is destroyed and a new network is created by the new host, after which all consoles reconnect.

## Changelog

| System version  | LDN version | Changes                                                                                              |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2.0.0 - 5.1.0   | 2           | Initial version                                                                                      |
| 6.0.0 - 18.1.0  | 3           | Challenge was added to authentication frame                                                          |
| 19.0.0 - 19.0.1 | 4           | No significant changes                                                                               |
| 20.0.0 - 20.4.0 | 4           | Support for AES-GCM encryption was added, and a band/channel field was added to advertisement frames |

## WLAN Channels
The channel on which LDN operates can be specified by games. Allowed channels are:

| Band    | Channels       |
|---------|----------------|
| 2.4 GHz | 1, 6, 11       |
| 5 GHz   | 36, 40, 44, 48 |

By default, LDN operates on one of the channels of the 2.4 GHz band (chosen arbitrarily).

During scanning, Nintendo uses a dwell time of 110 milliseconds.

## SSID
The SSID of the network contains 32 random hex digits. The network is hidden from other devices by zeroing the SSID in the beacon frame. To find the SSIDs of nearby networks, the console scans for [advertisement frames](#advertisement-frame).

## Authentication
When a suitable network has been found (by scanning for [advertisement frames](#advertisement-frame) on a given set of [channels](#wlan-channels)) the console may try to join the network, but Nintendo uses a custom authentication procedure:

1. The console joins the network using the open system authentication method. This is standard.
2. The console sends an encrypted [authentication request](#authentication-frame) to the access point. If the console does not send an authentication request within 5 seconds after step 1, the access point disassociates the console from the network.
3. The access point verifies the authentication request and sends an [authentication response](#authentication-frame) back to the console. If the console does not receive an authentication response from the access point within 700 milliseconds it resends the authentication request. After three attempts it gives up.
4. The console verifies the authentication response. If it is valid, and indicates success, the console is now part of the network and may communicate with other consoles.

## Encryption Keys
LDN supports three different security levels:

1. Both advertisement frames and data frames are encrypted.
2. Advertisement frames are encrypted, data frames are plaintext.
3. Advertisement frames and data frames are both plaintext.

The security level is specified during network creation and is broadcasted as part of the [advertisement frame](#advertisement-frame). In practice, the security level will always be set to 1, because security level 2 and 3 are only allowed during development.

Given a 16-byte input key and a buffer of arbitrary size, encryption keys are derived as follows:

1. `aes_kek_generation_source` is decrypted with master key generation 0.
2. The input key is decrypted with the key from step 1.
3. `aes_key_generation_source` is decrypted with the key from step 2.
4. The first 16 bytes of the SHA-256 hash of the input buffer are decrypted with the key from step 3.

For data frames, the input key is `f1e7018419a84f711da714c2cf919c9c` and the input buffer looks as follows:

| Offset | Size | Description                                           |
|--------|------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x0    | 16   | Network key (generated when the network is created)   |
| 0x10   | N    | Password specified by game (optional, up to 64 bytes) |

For advertisement frames, [see below](#advertisement-frame).

## IP Stack
When a console joins the network, the access point immediately assigns it an unused IP address. After joining the network, the console reads its own IP address and the IP addresses of the other consoles from the next [advertisement frame](#advertisement-frame). It then keeps monitoring [advertisement frames](#advertisement-frame) to get notified when a console joins or leaves the network.

IP addresses are of the form `169.254.X.Y` where X is a randomly generated during network creation, and Y is assigned to each station by the host. Because the host is always the first participant of the network, its IP address is always `169.254.X.1`. The broadcast address is `169.254.X.255`.

## Advertisement Frame
This is a vendor-specific action frame that is broadcasted by the access point every 100 milliseconds.

| 0x48   |      | [Advertisement data](#advertisement-data)                                               |

*AES-GCM*:

| 0x38   |      | Encrypted [Advertisement data](#advertisement-data) |

When AES-CTR is used, both the hash and advertisement data are encrypted. The input buffer for [key derivation](#encryption-keys) is the [session info](#session-info), and the input key is `191884743e24c77d87c69e4207d0c438`.

AES-GCM encryption must be explicitly enabled by games. It is mostly used by Switch 2 games.

### Advertisement Data
The format of the advertisement data depends on the encryption type that is specified in the [header](#advertisement-payload).

The authentication token is generated when the network is created and was added in LDN version 3. In previous versions it is set to 0. It is used during [authentication](#authentication).

The band and channel fields were added in version 20.0.0.

#### Authentication Status Code
This is set to 0 in an authentication request. In an authentication response, it is set to one of the following values:

| Value | Description                                       |

#### Challenge Request
The challenge was added to the authentication frame in LDN version 3. Its purpose is to make sure that the game was purchased separately on all communicating consoles. If a single purchase is used on multiple consoles, an error dialog is shown.

## Disconnect Frame
This is a data frame with ethertype 0x88B7 (OUI extended). It is usually [encrypted](#encryption-keys). This frame is sent when the access point disconnects a station from the network.
