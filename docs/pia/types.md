This page describes common data structures that are used by the Pia library.

## InetAddress
In version 5.11, a new encoding was introduced that is capable of representing IPv6 addresses. Even later Pia version still use the old encoding sometimes. Which encoding is used depends on the context.

#### Old version
This structure can only represent IPv4 addresses.

| Offset | Size | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0x0    | 4    | Address     |
| 0x4    | 2    | Port        |

#### New version
This structure can represent both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

| Offset | Size | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0x0    | 16   | Address     |
| 0x10   | 2    | Port        |

## StationAddress
In version 5.x, which [InetAddress](#inetaddress) encoding is used depends on the context. In version 6.x, the new encoding is always used.

*Up to 4.10:*

| Type                        | Description  |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| [InetAddress](#inetaddress) | Address      |
| Uint16                      | Extension id |

*5.2 - 6.23:*

| Type                        | Description |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| [InetAddress](#inetaddress) | Address     |

## StationLocation
The station location holds information that allows Pia to connect to a given station. Many fields are directly taken from a [station url](/docs/nex/types#stationurl), when NEX is used.

Up to Pia version 5.9, a station location contained either a public or a private address. In Pia 5.10 and later, it contains both.

*Up to 4.10:*

| Uint8                             | Unknown      |

### URL Type
The URL type depends on the scheme of the given station url. It is always 0 or 1 in practice.

| Value | Scheme   |
| ----- | -------- |
| 0     | Invalid  |
| 1     | `prudp`  |
| 2     | `prudps` |
| 3     | `udp`    |

## StationConnectionInfo
Up to Pia 5.9, a [station location](#stationlocation) contained either a public or private address. The station connection info contains both.

In Pia version 5.10, the station connection info structure was removed, and a single [station location](#stationlocation) contains both the public and private address of a station.

| Type                                | Description      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| [StationLocation](#stationlocation) | Public location  |
| [StationLocation](#stationlocation) | Private location |

## ReliableSlidingWindow
A reliable sliding window is used by various protocols to ensure that all messages arrive in the correct order. Large messages are fragmented. When a reliable sliding window is used, messages are wrapped as follows:
