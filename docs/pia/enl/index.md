ENL is Nintendo's private peer-to-peer framework that's used by many first-party games, such as Mario Kart 8, Splatoon 2 and Super Mario Maker 2. Check out the pages about [PIA](/docs/pia) for details on how a peer-to-peer session is set up. Once the session is ready, ENL sends all packets through the [unreliable protocol](/docs/pia/protocols/unreliable).

To transmit game-data, games can register content transporters to ENL. ENL also implements a few content transporters on its own.

A message consists of one or more records, terminated by a record with type 255. No byte swapping is done on the fields. The endianness depends on the system.

## Record Header

| Type   | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Uint8  | Record type |
| Uint16 | Record size |
| Bytes  | Record data |

| Record Type | Description                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 0 - 31      | Game-specific                               |
| 253         | [System request info](#system-request-info) |
| 254         | [System information](#system-information)   |
| 255         | End record                                  |

## System request info
Clients can use this to request a specific record from another client. Every non-zero bit in the record mask indicates a record type that the client wants to receive. The least significant bit represents record type 0, and the most significant bit represents record type 31.

On the Switch, a new field was added that lets a client request a system-record. Here, bit 0 represents record type 253, and bit 1 represents record type 254.
