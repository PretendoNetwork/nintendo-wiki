If the most significant bit is set an error occurred. Otherwise, the result indicates success. A list of error codes can be found in [nintendo/nex/errors.py](https://github.com/Kinnay/NintendoClients/blob/master/nintendo/nex/errors.py).

## DateTime

| Type   | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Uint64 | Value       |

This is not a normal time stamp. Instead, it consists of a bunch of bit fields:

## StationURL

| Type     | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [String] | Station URL |

A station url contains the address and port of a server or client, along with a few parameters. The order of the fields is arbitrary. Here's an example station url: `prudps:/stream=10;sid=1;CID=1;type=2;address=34.210.222.104;port=60101;PID=2`

| Field             | Description               |

| fastproberesponse | Fast probe response       |
| NodeID            | Node id                   |

The following fields were added on Nintendo Switch:

| Field | Description                             |

| Rsp   | Relay server port                       |
| Ra    | Relay address                           |
| Rp    | Relay port                              |
| Tpt   | Transport protocol type                 |
| Pl    | Platform type                           |
| Ntrpa | NAT traversal requester private address |
| Ntrpp | NAT traversal requester private port    |

## Variant
A variant consists of an uint8 indicating the type followed by its value.

| Type id | Type       |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 0       | None       |
| 1       | Sint64     |
| 2       | Double     |
| 3       | Bool       |
| 4       | [String]   |
| 5       | [DateTime] |
| 6       | Uint64     |

## Structure
When using the ["verbose" RMC variation](/docs/rmc) the structure version information is stored in the [ClassVersionContainer](/docs/rmc#classversioncontainer). When using the ["packed" RMC variation](/docs/rmc), and the client is using NEX v3.5.0 or above, the structures version information is encoded as a header before the structures contents. Before NEX v3.5.0, the structures contents are encoded directly into the stream without a version header

### Structure header

| Type   | Description    |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Uint8  | Version        |
| Uint32 | Content length |
|        | Content        |

Nintendo often seems to be changing a structure without updating its version number though.

### Structure Inheritance

A structure may inherit another structure. The child is stored right after the parent, and gets its own version header.

Example: If there are 2 structures, `StructureA` and `StructureB`, with `StructureB` inheriting from `StructureA`, the data would be stored as follows:

* `StructureA` Structure Header (if any)
* `StructureA` Structure data  (if any)
* `StructureB` Structure Header (if any)
* `StructureB` Structure data  (if any)

## Data ([Structure])
This struct does not have any fields.

## AnyDataHolder
This class can hold any object derived from a given base class (usually [nn::nex::Data](#data-structure)). Some meta data is sent along with it, so the other side can properly identify and decode the object.

| Type     | Description                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [String] | Type name                                       |
| Uint32   | Length of data, including the next length field |
| Uint32   | Length of data                                  |
|          | Object data                                     |

## RVConnectionData ([Structure])
Nintendo does not use any special protocols.

| Type                       | Name                  | Description                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [StationURL](#station-url) | m_urlRegularProtocols | Server address (regular protocols) |
| [List](#list)&lt;byte&gt;  | m_lstSpecialProtocols | Special protocols                  |
| [StationURL](#station-url) | m_urlSpecialProtocols | Server address (special protocols) |

Revision 1:

| Type                   | Name             | Description |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| [DateTime](#date-time) | m_currentUTCTime | Time        |

Examples:

| Game    | Secure server                                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Friends | `prudps:/stream=10;type=2;PID=2;port=60091;address=35.162.205.114;sid=1;CID=1` |
| DKC:TF  | `prudps:/port=43221;CID=1;address=34.208.166.202;PID=2;stream=10;type=2;sid=1` |
| MK8     | `prudps:/sid=1;port=59201;address=52.10.188.163;PID=2;stream=10;type=2;CID=1`  |

## ResultRange ([Structure])
Some methods query a large set of objects. These methods normally take a ResultRange parameter that limits the number of objects that are returned.

| Type   | Name       | Description |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| Uint32 | m_uiOffset | Offset      |
| Uint32 | m_uiSize   | Length      |

[String]: #string
[Structure]: #structure
[DateTime]: #date-time
