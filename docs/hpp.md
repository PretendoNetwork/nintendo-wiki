title: HPP Protocol

As an alternative to [PRUDP](/docs/prudp), Nintendo provides an HTTP server that can be used to call [NEX methods](/docs/nex/protocols).

The server is at `https://hpp-<game server id>-<environment>.n.app.nintendo.net/hpp/`. The environment is one of L, C, S, D, I, T, J or U, followed by a single decimal digit.

The following headers are sent in requests:

| Header     | Description          |
|------------|----------------------|
| pid        | User id              |
| version    | NEX version string   |
| token      | Always "normaltoken" |
| signature1 | Access key signature |
| signature2 | Password signature   |

The signatures are a HMAC-MD5 over the request buffer. The key of signature1 is the access key of the game server, padded with zeroes until it is 8 bytes long. The key of signature2 is derived from the account password, using the [Kerberos key derivation](/docs/nex/kerberos#key-derivation) algorithm.

Most game servers can not be accessed through the hpp server, but the following servers are known to work:

| Game Server ID | NEX Version     | Game                                |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
