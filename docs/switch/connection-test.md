title: Connection Test
---

Nintendo provides three connection test servers for the Nintendo Switch:
* http://ctest.cdn.nintendo.net
* http://ctest-dl-lp1.cdn.nintendo.net
* http://ctest-ul-lp1.cdn.nintendo.net
* https://api.hac.lp1.ctest.srv.nintendo.net

The first server is used to check if the internet connection is working when you connect to a wifi network. The next two are used to measure your download and upload speed.

The last server was introduced in system version 18.0.0 and is a replacement for `/v1/time` of the [AAuth server](/docs/switch/aauth).

## API
The server provides two endpoints:
* `/v1/ip`
* `/v1/time`

## Errors
If the user agent does not start with `NX NIFM/` (during connection test) or `Nintendo` (for the other servers) the server sends the following response instead:

```
